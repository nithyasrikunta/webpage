Description:

This project is a web page created using Python and Streamlit. It allows users to input their name, age, email, and date of birth. The data input by users is stored and retrieved using the SQLite3 library to interact with a database.

Features:

User-friendly interface for inputting personal information.
Data validation to ensure accurate inputs.
Storage of user data in an SQLite database.
Retrieval of stored data for display or further processing.
Usage:

Run the Streamlit web application using the following command:
arduino
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Access the web page through your browser.
Input your name, age, email, and date of birth.
Click on the appropriate buttons to store or retrieve data as needed.
SQLite3 Database:

This project utilizes SQLite3, a lightweight relational database management system.
The SQLite3 database file (database.db) is automatically created upon running the application for the first time.
Data is stored in a single table with columns for name, age, email, and date of birth.
SQLite3 offers reliability and efficiency for storing and querying structured data, making it suitable for this project's requirements.
Dependencies:

Python 3.x
Streamlit
Pandas
